## Hey there, I'm Skub! 👋  
### *The Human Behind the Code (and the Chaos)*  

Welcome to my corner of the digital circus, where code contorts into wild creations and bugs tremble at the sound of my keyboard. I’m a chai‑fuelled programmer from India who builds tools, games, and systems so quirky they practically write themselves (but don’t tell them that).

## 🎩 About Me  

- **🌏 Location**: Somewhere between “just one more line” and “why won’t this compile?”—India edition.  
- **🤓 Philosophy**: No dark sorcery—only straightforward code, sprinkled with ridiculous comments and the occasional rubber duck.  
- **🛠️ Mastery & Mayhem**:  
  - **Mastered**: Rust (fearless memory taming), C (because masochism is a feature).  
  - **Learning**: Zig (to confuse even myself), Haskell (for my own amusement).  
- **🐧 OS Adventures**:  
  - Juggling NixOS and EndeavourOS like flaming torches—dreaming of NixOS monogamy one day.  
- **🎯 Side Quests**:  
  - Building shells, crafting mini‑languages, and blaming the compiler for my life choices.

## 🤩 Featured Shenanigans  

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [**sip**](https://github.com/skubed0007/sip)   | A systems‑language so zany it might juggle your semicolons.  |
| [**xinux**](https://github.com/skubed0007/xinux) | My minimal bash‑compatible shell, now with extra sass.      |
| [**neit**](https://github.com/oxumlabs/neit)    | A programmable blank slate. (AKA “extreme minimalism.”)     |
| [**ven**](https://github.com/oxumlabs/ven)      | IR‑only language: because less is more… until it breaks.    |

*More projects incoming as I break things, fix them, and break them again—rinse & repeat!*

## 🔮 What I’m Scheming Next  

- **🤖 Toolsmithing**: Inventing utilities that make your life easier—and mine more chaotic.  
- **🎮 Game Dev**: Someday I’ll finish that rogue‑like engine in Rust. Someday…  
- **💥 Custom libc “sipc”**: Because why settle for glibc when you can sipc?
