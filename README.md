## Hey there, I'm Skub! 👋  
### *The Human Behind the Code (and the Chaos)*  

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where code meets creativity, and bugs meet their doom. I'm a passionate programmer from India who loves building tools, games, and systems that make people smile (or at least scratch their heads in awe).

## 🚀 About Me  

- **🌍 Location**: Somewhere in India, sipping chai and writing code  
- **💡 Philosophy**: No magic, no shortcuts—just clear, intentional code (and a healthy dose of humor)  
- **🛠️ Languages**:  
  - **Mastered**: Rust, C (because who doesn’t love a challenge?)  
  - **Learning**: Zig, Haskell (because why not make life harder?)  
- **💻 Tools & OS**:  
  - **OS Adventures**: Currently juggling between NixOS and EndeavourOS like a circus act, but dreaming of settling down with Nix someday (because Linux is life, and stability is a myth I chase).  
  - Building cool stuff with Rust every day (and occasionally breaking it)  
- **🎯 Interests**:  
  - Tool development, game development, and making people smile (or cry, depending on the bug count)  
- **🏆 Goals**:  
  - **Short-term**: Build a shell, a terminal, a game, and a game engine in Rust  
  - **Long-term**: Work at Valve (because dreams are free)

## 🎯 Tech Stack  

- **Programming Languages**: Rust, C#, Python (currently diving into JavaScript and C++)  
- **Operating System**: Linux Mint (*switching OS is my cardio*)  
- **Development Tools**:  
  - VSCode (with all the extensions I can cram in)  
  - The power of Rust & Linux command-line wizardry

## 🤩 Projects I’ve Crafted (and More to Come!)  

Here’s a taste of what I’ve been brewing in my coding lab:  

- **[sip](https://github.com/skubed0007/sip):** A programming language that doesn't even know magic exists.  
- **[xinux](https://github.com/skubed0007/xinux):** A hobby project for writing a minimal bash-compatible shell in Rust.  
- **[neit](https://github.com/oxumlabs/neit):** A programming language for extreme simplicity (because why not?).  
- **[ven](https://github.com/oxumlabs/ven):** An IR programming language because minimalism is awesome!  

*More projects will be added soon as I build, break, and rebuild them to perfection (or at least until they stop crashing).*

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On  

- **Tool Development**: Crafting systems and utilities that are robust, efficient, and delightfully quirky.  
~~- **Game Development**: Creating engaging indie games using Unity and custom-built engines in Rust.~~  
~~- **Open Source Contributions**: Sharing my code and projects to spread smiles and inspiration around the globe.~~
